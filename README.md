# Cats & Dogs Words

A open-source Wordle clone made by me and my 7yo daughter!

It's Wordle, except my daughter had two changes she wanted to make:

1. She wanted to choose the secret word (perfect for challenging mommy and daddy)
2. Cats

You can [play the current version](https://cats-and-dogs.club/games/words/) on the Cats & Dogs Club website.

My daughter and I have been doing lots of learning projects. We started by learning basic HTML and building the first version of the [Cats & Dogs Club](https://cats-and-dogs.club/). These days we learn with [code.org](https://code.org), [Tynker](https://www.tynker.com) (a well-done Scratch-like environment for the iPad), and [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) (lots of great educational content). Before this project, we built one [silly game directly with Javascript](https://cats-and-dogs.club/games/chase/index.html), but this project is a pretty big leap into the land of Typescript, React, bundlers, yadda yadda. The current state of javascript tooling is bonkers, so I mostly just set that stuff up myself and got back to writing code with the kiddo. I know people sing their praises but, to me, React function components and hooks still seem like an awkward match for javascript. Gave 'em a go anyway.
