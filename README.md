# 🐱 & 🐶 Words

A open-source Wordle clone made by me and my 7yo daughter!

It's Wordle, except my daughter had two changes she wanted to make:

1. She wanted to choose the secret word (perfect for challenging mommy and daddy)
2. Cats

You can [play this on the Cats & Dogs Club website](https://words.cats-and-dogs.club/).

### Why?

My daughter and I have been doing lots of learning projects.

We started by learning basic HTML and building the first version of the [Cats & Dogs Club](https://cats-and-dogs.club/) by hand. 

These days we learn with [Tynker](https://www.tynker.com) (a well-done Scratch-like environment for the iPad), [code.org](https://code.org), and [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) (lots of great educational content). 

Before this project, we built one [silly game by hand with Javascript](https://cats-and-dogs.club/games/chase/index.html), but this project is a pretty big leap into the land of TypeScript, React, bundlers, yadda yadda. 

The current state of front-end tooling is bonkers, so I mostly just set that stuff up myself and got back to writing code with the kiddo. You can find the boilerplate in the [🐱 & 🐶 Boilerplate repository](https://github.com/davepeck/cats-and-dogs-boilerplate/)
